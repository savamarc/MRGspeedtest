Simple MRG speed tests using Vigna's harness. This is here mostly to share
between computers and test on different architectures. Make will run all
generators. Check parameters before runing, numbers can be a bit high.

Example usages (compiles and run the test 10 times for the generator):
```
make
./compile.sh mrg59k3a 1000000 5
```
